# Sokoban-platformer

Hey there.. 
I was the guy who posted this little gif of a "Sokoban Platformer" game 
and i did worked on it a bit but unfortunatly i do not have any time for it..

So i will give all of you the source code open so you guys can turn this gif into a real game. 
Consider letting me know if its done and feel free to credit me.

So.. i dont know what to say,
i did messed up the code a bit so it might be hard to read and understand because it have its own gridbased physic system, 

which works 
kinda.. 

ya.. Cheers i guess
